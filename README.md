dzenotify
=========

Well, arguable it is a way for showing notifications.

Uses the almighty [dzen](https://github.com/robm/dzen) for displaying notification text.

Why?
====

[dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst) is too robust, configurable and awesome maybe?

How?
====

Run `dzenotify` thusly:

    dzenotify "Hi, Ho" "Let's Go"
